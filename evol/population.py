    """Population which is evaluated through contests.

    This variant of the Population is used when individuals cannot be
    evaluated on a one-by-one basis, but instead can only be compared to
    each other. This is typically the case for AI that performs some task
    (i.e. plays a game), but can be useful in many other cases.

    For each round of evaluation, each individual participates in a given
    number of contests, in which a given number of individuals take part.
    The resulting scores of these contests are summed to form the fitness.

    Since the fitness of an individual is dependent on the other individuals
    in the population, the fitness of all individuals is recalculated when
    new individuals are present, and the fitness of all individuals is reset
    when the population is modified (e.g. by calling survive, mutate etc).

    :param chromosomes: Iterable of initial chromosomes of the Population.
    :param eval_function: Function that reduces a chromosome to a fitness.
    :param maximize: If True, fitness will be maximized, otherwise minimized.

    :param individuals_per_contest: Number of individuals that take part in
        each contest. The size of the population must be divisible by this
        number. Defaults to 2.
    :param contests_per_round: Minimum number of contests each individual
        takes part in for each evaluation round. The actual number of contests
        per round is a multiple of individuals_per_contest. Defaults to 10.
    :param generation: Generation of the Population. This is incremented after
        echo survive call. Defaults to 0.
    :param intended_size: Intended size of the Population. The population will
        be replenished to this size by .breed(). Defaults to the number of
        chromosomes provided.
    :param checkpoint_target: Target for the serializer of the Population. If
        a serializer is provided, this target is ignored. Defaults to None.
    :param serializer: Serializer for the Population. If None, a new
        SimpleSerializer is created. Defaults to None.
    :param concurrent_workers: If > 1, evaluate individuals in {concurrent_workers}
        separate processes. If None, concurrent_workers is set to n_cpus. Defaults to 1.
