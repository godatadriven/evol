Development
***********

We currently support python3.6 and python3.7 and you can install it via pip.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install evol

You can also fork/clone the repository on Github_ to work on it locally. we've
added a `Makefile` to the project that makes it easy to install everything ready
for development.

.. code-block:: bash

   make develop
